software-construction & Devlopment

COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course is design to introduce fundamental principles and techniques of software development i.e.
• Easy to understand, error free and modifiable object oriented programs and small scale systems.
• To deal with code complexity, changeability, reusability.
To build individual programs as assignments and projects in teams to explicitly learn unit development and integration issues.

COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES (CLO)
CLO: 1. Explain important concepts of code by design; object oriented design translations into object oriented code i.e. abstraction, modularity, and concurrency, software design patterns, error free programming, unit and integration testing, debugging, (C1-Knowledge)
CLO: 2. Select and apply appropriate object oriented programming to constructs; optimized, error free, and reusable, code as individual developer. (C3-Application)
CLO: 3. Design and develop a small software system as a team by using appropriate programming, testing, and integration tools and techniques. (C3-Application)
